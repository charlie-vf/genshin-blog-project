Genshin Community Blog

Introduction

This blog was created for my fourth project in Code Institute's Full-Stack Software Development Course.
It is a blog for Genshin Impact players to come together and share their experiences with the game, whatever they may be. 
Users can create, edit & delete their own posts, and interact with others' posts, too!

UX

User Stories

- As a Site User I can browse a paginated list of posts so that I can see all posts on the blog.
- As a Site User I can browse individual categories so that I can find posts related to my topic of interest.
- As a Site User I can register an account so that I can create posts and like & comment on other posts.
- As a Site User I can edit and delete my own posts.
- As a Site User I can click on posts so that view the full content and the comment discussion.
- As a Site User I can comment on posts so that I can talk to others & share my experiences with the game.
- As a Site User I can like/unlike posts so that I can interact with other content.

Admin Stories

- As a Site Admin I can view posts in an editor so that I can manage the blog's content effectively.
- As a Site Admin I can view & approve comments before they are posted so that I can moderate content on the site.

Development

This site is loosely based on inspiration from Reddit feeds and the HoyoLab website (a website by the game's creators for players of their two related games), however time constraints and abilities altered the finished outcome.

Strategy

My aim with this website was to create an easily navigatable, minimilistic site for casual blogging by Genshin players.
Whilst the main goal is sharing content, it could also be used as a means for players to keep track of their favourite moments, build highlights and more.

Target audiences:

- Players of Genshin Impact
- People looking for a new game to play that has a healthy community

The website should allow Users to:

- Browse posts and narrow by category
- Create an account
- Create, edit and delete posts
- Like and comment on posts from other Users

The website should allow the Admin to:

- Manage comments on posts
- Override user authentication to delete posts which violate the idea of a healthy community

Scope

Time constraints limited the amount of features from the original plan I was able to implement, however priority scoring ensured the most important features made their way into the finished site.

The UX must:

- Allow Users to create an account
- Allow Users to create posts
- Allow Users to browse all posts, or by category

The UX should:

- Allow Users to edit & delete their posts if authorised
- Allow Users to comment & like on other posts

The UX may (future implementation):

- Allow Users to update their password
- Allow Users to create accounts with social media

Skeleton

All pages follow the same basic setup, with the Wireframe created using Figma.

Design

Various styling elements were taken from the free Bootstrap template Greyscale (link in credits section)

Colors

My theme with the webpages I have created thusfar is purples, blues and black. For this site, as Genshin Impact is an incredibly bright game, visually, I chose to scrap the black and stick to purples, blues, white and light-grey.
As this site is heavily image-based, a white background best displays the images, and aids in accessibility when using purples.

Header

The header is the main feature of each page, with a full-width image and gradient text. For this reason, I chose a purple-themed image and white text to contrast the other headings on the pages.

Fonts

I have used some harsher fonts on websites in the past, however for this site I chose to stick with gentler fonts. 
The fonts used were Roboto and Lato, from Google Fonts.

Images

Users can upload their own images when publishing to the site; otherwise, a default image will load onto their post. This image is editable at any point using the Edit Post function.

Features

Design

Nav Bar

The navigation bar features an oft-memed quote from the game ('Te Nnadayo'), links Home, Create a Post, Categories dropdown and Register/Login/Logout, as well as the site's name on the far right.
On smaller screens, the navigation bar condenses into a full dropdown menu.

Header

The header features the site's name and a small extract summarising the purpose of the site. It is backed by a themed image taken from the most recent expansion in-game.
